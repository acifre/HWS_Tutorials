All three of these tasks require you to modify the **FilteredListView** view we made:

# TODO

- [X] Make it accept a string parameter that controls which predicate is applied. You can use Swiftâ€™s string interpolation to place this in the predicate.

- [X] Modify the predicate string parameter to be an enum such as .beginsWith, then make that enum get resolved to a string inside the initializer.

- [ ] Make FilteredList accept an array of SortDescriptor objects to get used in its fetch request.
